Create a java backend application to keep track to all the employees of an IT company. 
The backend should use Rest calls (GET, POST, …) and JSon data format. 

The following ‘models’ should be implemented: 
	•	employee (some basic data - name, CNP, etc.)
	•	QA employee (a model that is an employee, but has some extra info/	attributes: e. g.: general QA level (1-9)
	•	dev employee (the same as QA, but different attributes)
	•	TL QA (a model that is an QA employee - but with some extra specific TL attributes)
	•	TL dev (the same as above)
	•	PM 
	•	etc. 

The rest calls should allow a client application to: 
	•	add new employees 
	•	view all the employees
	•	filtrate employees 
	•	update existing 
	•	convert from one model to another (e.g. QA -> dev or dev -> TL dev) 

You should use the OOP principles as much as possible (minimum: Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation), use collections for data manipulation, use java coding best practices, javadoc comments for all your code.  

Use Git as version control system. (create branches, merge, create PR’s, review, ...)
